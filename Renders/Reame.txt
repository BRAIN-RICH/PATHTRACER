The folder 'Thesis' contains the exact renders used in the thesis.
Here I included some higher resolution renders that should better demonstrate the algorithm. Most of them are rendered with 300 iterations using the submitted code.

The files 'TF#' use the same transfer function conffiguration but with different transparency values for the tissues.
Note the different materials types (e.g. bone vs skin). Also note the shadow that the nose casts on the check in picture TF5 vs TF6.

Pictures 'Indirect-without' and 'Indirect-with' show the same image traced with 1, respectively 50 rays per sample.
Indirect light contributes greatly to the image quality and depth perception.
Similarity, 'Subsurface-without' and 'Subsurface-with' show the same image traced with 1, respectively 50 rays per sample.

The file 'Mirror' shows the volume rendered with a mirror BRDF inside the Cornell box.
In this case, a more sophisticated interpolation algorithm would make a large difference (trilinear interpolation's main advantage is its performance).

Finally, the file 'Cornell' shows the standard volume inside the Cornell box. This scene presents a nice mix of direct and indirect lighting, colour bleeding, volumetric shadows and specular highlights.
